# Project 0 - Requirements

write a python application!
- retail store ordering/inventory system
- journal/note taking app
- calculator
- to-do app
- business/account management system
- expense tracking system
- password manager
- bank account manager
- productivity/automation tool
- (very simple) text-based game
- text/sql database parser
- web api client

## Recommended:
- have both interactive mode...

      (looking at input() from the user,
      and/or using a package like pynput to read individual key presses directly
      without the user having to press "enter")
      (consider the blessings package for a text-based UI)
- ...and non-interactive mode

      (accepting some command-line arguments using the argparse module, or sys.argv directly,
      to do some operations or outputting without needing the user to type more
      so it could be used in a automated script

i'll be glad to help guide anybody's brainstorming on features or on implementation details.

## Requirements
- The app must work with either the file system, or the network, in some way.
    for example, it stores or processes data in files (maybe using pickle format, or some text format like csv)
- It must be something that you can make a simple crappy version of in a day, but you can imagine several directions for improving and extending it.
- Manage the development using git and github. \
    make a repository named "<firstname><lastinitial>-project0" in the batch organization
- "how much do i have to implement?" "what are my exact requirements?" \
    impress me! and keep pace with your fellow batchmates.
